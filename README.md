# Spotify-Playlist-Recommender
Project to recommend spotify playlists based on a user's favorite songs
Pulls information from Spotify API, then uses Spotify's provided info to find songs with similar characteristics

In order to run:

1.Download the project
\n2.The database of songs has been initially set up, so all you have to do is run the gui.py file to have the gui pop up with instructions
\n3. When the gui is running, it may seem like it is frozen, but it is not. Just allow it to run until completion, and then a command line message should print saying your song list has been generated
